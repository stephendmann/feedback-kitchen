# Inspection Checklist

Each item gates one or more board cards. Resolve = answer the question, record findings
here (don't fix anything during inspection — findings only), then move the gated card.

---

## INS-1 ☐ Does a cohort record round-trip back into the marking session?
- **Gates:** FK-07 (queue/re-entry) — scope forks on the answer.
- **Where to look:** scorer.html cohort-store functions (search: `cohort`, `View list` handler, whatever populates "0 students saved"); `js/moderation-schema.js` for record shape; try it live in dev server: save a student, open View list, attempt re-edit.
- **Questions:**
  1. Are saved records full-fidelity (per-criterion levels + overrides + feedback slots + notes), or flattened/export-shaped?
  2. Is there any existing load-record-into-session code path, even unexposed?
  3. Does re-saving create a duplicate row or update in place (keyed how — name? ID? timestamp)?
- **Findings:** _(pending)_

## INS-2 ◐ What do "Moderation Export…" and "Export for Moderation" each do?
- **Gates:** FK-08.
- **Where to look:** both button handlers in scorer.html; `js/moderation-export.js`, `js/moderation-optin.js`, `js/moderation-suppression.js`; `docs/fk_moderation_export_v1.md`.
- **Questions:**
  1. Configure-vs-run, or genuine duplication?
  2. How do opt-in/suppression interact with each ("Disable mod-export" button suggests a tri-state)?
  3. Does Clear Cohort currently confirm before destroying? (feeds FK-06 DoD)
- **Findings:** _(Q1/Q2 pending — Q3 answered 2026-06-11, Phase 0 kickoff)_
  - **Q3: YES — double confirmation already exists.** `confirmClearCohort()` scorer.html:2640–2652: two sequential `confirm()` dialogs (2647, 2648), the first naming the student count and warning "cannot be undone… export first". Caveat: when the cohort is **empty**, it clears silently with no dialog (2642–2646) — harmless but worth knowing. A separate unguarded `SA.clearCohort` call exists at 2853 — appears to be inside a modal-confirm flow; FK-06 implementation should verify that path's guard.
  - O — button markup observed: Clear Cohort is `btn-ghost text-red-600` (1175), last of 8 buttons in one flex row (1166–1176); already partially differentiated by colour but at equal visual weight. Primary candidates per BOARD: Export cohort (btn-blue, 1167), Cohort Insights (1168, hidden until data), View list (1169).
  - FK-06 scope consequence: the "add confirmation" half of the DoD is already satisfied — remaining work is visual demotion/grouping only. Q1/Q2 (moderation pair semantics) still gate FK-08 and stay open.

## INS-3 ◐ Map the scoring calculation surface in scorer.html
- **Gates:** FK-09 (engine extraction); informs FK-15 boundaries. **Inspection only — changes no code.** Findings shape FK-09's eventual module boundary (Phase 2), not FK-01.
- **Where to look:** start from `onPenaltyChange` (scorer.html:1824), `setRounding`/`highlightRoundingBtn` (~:3153–3185), `cloneScoreResultForStorage` (~:2585); trace the weighted-total computation; cross-ref `scoreToGrade`/`scoreToGradeFromScale` call sites in shared.js (lines 394–726 region).
- **Questions:**
  1. Full list of functions that read or write score state.
  2. What shared/global state do they touch (DOM reads? module-level vars? localStorage directly?).
  3. Order of operations: override → weight → penalty → rounding? Where can they interleave?
  4. Is D5 weight-redistribution math in builder.html, scorer.html, or both (duplication risk)?
- **Execution checklist (remaining steps to reach ☑):**
  - [x] Locate the engine core and confirm where the arithmetic actually lives (done — see findings).
  - [x] Resolve order of operations (Q3 — done, see findings).
  - [ ] Q1 (complete the list): enumerate *every* caller of `recalculate()` (12+ call sites: 1452, 1583, 1633, 1679, 1752, 1815, 1819, 1846, 2301→, 2311→, 3142, 3192) and classify each as state-writer vs display-refresher.
  - [ ] Q2 (complete the list): list module-level score state in scorer.html (`scoreResult`, `studentGrades`, `latePenaltyIdx`, `_displayRounding`, `focusIdx`) and which functions mutate each; note any direct localStorage writes in the score path (`cloneScoreResultForStorage` ~:2585 → cohort save).
  - [ ] Q4: D5 redistribution grep came back **empty** (`redistribut|rebalance|weightDelta` — 0 hits in scorer.html, builder.html, js/*). Either it's named differently or it doesn't exist — search builder.html weight-editing handlers by hand and record the verdict.
  - [ ] Confirm `highlightRoundingBtn` / `setRounding` only affect *display* rounding (`_displayRounding` → `SA.formatScore`) vs `config.scoreRounding` (→ inside `computeScores`); document the two-rounding-systems distinction.
- **Findings:** _(2026-06-11, Phase 0 kickoff — partial)_
  - **The engine core is ALREADY in shared.js, not inline in scorer.html.** `recalculate()` (scorer.html:1858) delegates: `SA.computeScores(config, studentGrades, latePenaltyIdx)` → `SA.applyGradeOverride(config, scoreResult, overrideGrade)` — then does pure DOM writes. Engine functions in js/shared.js: `computeScores` (325), `applyGradeOverride` (194), `scoreToGrade` (158), `scoreToGradeFromScale` (167), `bandMinimumForGrade` (178), `formatScore` (1188). **FK-09's scope shrinks substantially:** it's less "extract the engine" and more "test what's already extracted + move the remaining DOM-reading glue (override input parse, penalty index read) behind a clean interface".
  - **Q3 resolved — order of operations** (computeScores, shared.js:325–397): per-criterion numeric override ?? grade midpoint → ×weight/100 → **per-row rounding** (config.scoreRounding) → sum of *rounded* rows → round total → late penalty (flat deduction, or fail→0) → round again → grade lookup (`scoreToGrade[FromScale]`). Marker *letter* override applied afterwards in a separate pass (`applyGradeOverride`): snaps total UP to band minimum only (never down), re-applies the penalty deduction delta, attaches audit metadata.
  - **Notable behaviour (feed FK-01 test design):** weightedTotal deliberately sums the *displayed/rounded* per-row scores — comment at shared.js:373–376 calls out the trade ("sub-0.5 precision drift for perfect visual consistency"). Characterization tests must assert this, not "pure" arithmetic.
  - **Notable behaviour:** `scoreToGradeFromScale` returns the *lowest* band's grade for any score below all bands (shared.js:172–173) and will throw on an empty/missing scale (no guard on `sorted[length-1]` — `.grade` of undefined). Unknown grade keys in `computeScores` fall back to midpoint 50 / tier 'developing'. Record any further oddities in INS-4 once FK-01 tests run.
  - **Fail-penalty interaction:** `lp.fail` zeroes the score and forces the bottom grade; `onPenaltyChange` (scorer.html:1824–1847) additionally *clears* any letter override and shows a conflict banner (1833–1845).

## INS-4 ☐ Characterization-test surprises ledger
- **Gates:** none (FK-01 is safe-now); this item *collects* what FK-01 discovers.
- **Rule (operational):** test the behaviour **as it is** — the assertion captures what the code *does*, not what it *should* do. File the surprise here using the template. Fix only in a separate commit, only after triage, never inside the FK-01 test commit.
- **Surprise template (copy per entry):**
  ```
  ### S-n · <one-line title>
  - Input: <exact call, e.g. scoreToGradeFromScale(50, [])>
  - Expected: <what a reasonable reader would predict>
  - Actual: <what the code does — quote the test assertion>
  - Suspected cause: <line ref + hypothesis>
  - Triage: bug / intended / unclear
  - Action: <none | follow-up commit ref | new card>
  ```
- **Pre-seeded candidates from the Phase 0 kickoff read (verify when writing tests):**
  - `scoreToGradeFromScale(score, [])` → TypeError (no empty-scale guard, shared.js:173).
  - Score below all bands returns the lowest band's grade even for negative/NaN-ish inputs — check `NaN >= floor` is false for every band, so NaN falls through to the floor grade in both functions.
  - `scoreToGrade` with non-numeric string: `'80' >= 80` is true (string coercion) — does it band correctly for numeric strings? Capture as-is.
  - weightedTotal sums *rounded* per-row values (shared.js:376) — totals can differ from unrounded arithmetic by design.
- **Findings:** _(pending — populate during FK-01)_

## INS-5 ☐ localStorage capacity and failure-mode measurement
- **Gates:** FK-10; outcome decides whether a migration card gets created at all.
- **Method:**
  1. Mark 2–3 demo students fully; measure serialized bytes per record (`JSON.stringify` length of the relevant keys).
  2. Extrapolate to 100/300-record cohorts; compare against ~5MB/origin.
  3. Grep scorer.html/shared.js for `try`/`catch` around `setItem` — is QuotaExceededError handled? Surfaced to the user or silent?
  4. Note what else shares the origin's quota (scorers, snippets, cohort).
- **Decision rule:** if a 300-record cohort projects under ~40% of quota AND quota errors are surfaced, no migration card; otherwise open FK-17 (IndexedDB behind a SessionStore interface).
- **Findings:** _(pending)_

## INS-6 ☐ When is rubric_version_hash computed?
- **Gates:** FK-11.
- **Where to look:** `js/moderation-schema.js:82` and wherever that field is populated (moderation-export.js, scorer cohort-save path).
- **Questions:**
  1. Stamped per record at mark/save time, or computed once at export from the *current* rubric?
  2. What feeds the hash (full rubric JSON? weights only?) — does editing a statement bank change it?
  3. Is `fk_version` (line 91) app version or schema version?
- **Findings:** _(pending)_

## INS-7 ☐ What does cohort-insights.js already compute?
- **Gates:** FK-12.
- **Where to look:** `js/cohort-insights.js` (610 lines).
- **Questions:**
  1. Available stats (distributions? per-criterion? per-tutor?).
  2. Are they computed on demand from the cohort store (reusable in-flow) or only inside the insights view?
- **Findings:** _(pending)_

## INS-8 ☐ ARIA usage inventory in scorer.html
- **Gates:** FK-13.
- **Method:** `grep -n "aria-invalid\|aria-describedby\|aria-live\|role=" scorer.html` + skim each cluster.
- **Questions:**
  1. Is validation state set from one place or per-widget?
  2. Any aria-live regions for score updates / focus-mode navigation announcements?
- **Verdict to record:** ad-hoc (open a backlog card) vs adequate (drop FK-13).
- **Findings:** _(pending)_

## INS-9 ☑ Pre-flight for section reorder (FK-05) — positional lookups
- **Gates:** none (FK-05 is safe-now with this as its first task, not a blocker).
- **Method (greps run 2026-06-11):**
  - `grep -n "children\[" scorer.html` → **0 hits**
  - `grep -n "nextElementSibling\|previousElementSibling" scorer.html` → **0 hits**
  - `grep -n "closest(" scorer.html` → 1 hit (1283, `closest('.hidden')` visibility check — order-independent, benign)
  - `grep -in "textContent.*===\|headerText\|matchHeader" scorer.html` → 0 positional header-matching hits (the `textContent` writes at 2757/2764 set the rail label; they don't look anything up)
- **Findings (resolved 2026-06-11):**
  1. **No DOM-positional section lookups remain.** The b00cb54/370a272-era hardening already removed them. Focus-mode navigation is criterion-index based (`focusIdx`, `getElementById('grade-sel-' + i)` etc., scorer.html:2298–2339) — independent of section order entirely.
  2. Scroll-spy rail uses an explicit ID array + IntersectionObserver (4842–4855) — functionally order-independent, but the **rail link markup order (427–434) must be manually re-sequenced** to match the new visual order, or the rail will read out of order.
  3. **Residual hazards for FK-05 (both letter-keyed, not position-keyed):** focus-mode CSS `[data-rail="B"]/[data-rail="D"]` hide rules and C/E/F/G dim rules (118–127) — these break if FK-02 de-letters `data-rail` values, so FK-02 and FK-05 must re-key them together (use href- or id-based attributes); and the focus-enter collapse logic targets `#sec-adjust` by ID (2168–2178) — safe under reorder, verify in runtime anyway.
  4. Conclusion: **FK-05 is safe to implement** — it's a markup-move plus rail re-sequence; runtime validation (Previous/Next/Exit, nav strip, expand/collapse-all) remains the DoD gate.
