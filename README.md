## Overview

Score Automator is the web successor to the original Excel-based Feedback Kitchen. It works the same way — enter grades per criterion, get a weighted total, copy polished feedback — but runs entirely in your browser with no spreadsheet required.

Each **Scorer** you build is specific to one assessment. You can have as many as you like saved on your device, each with its own criteria, weightings, rubric descriptors, grade scale, and feedback templates.

---

## Getting Started

1. Open the app and click **Build a New Scorer**
2. Work through the 6-step wizard (details below)
3. Click **Save & Launch** — your scorer opens immediately and is saved for future use
4. To return to a saved scorer later, find it in the **Your Kitchens** section on the home page

---

## Using the Scorer

Once a scorer is open:

### 1. Enter Student Details
Fill in the fields at the top of the page:
- **Student Name**
- **Student ID**
- **Tutor name**
- **Date** (auto-populated)

These are recommended for record-keeping and to assist with any student query.

### 2. Grade Each Criterion
For each criterion listed:
1. Select the **Grade** from the dropdown (e.g. A, B+, C-)
2. The **Midpoint Score** auto-populates based on the selected grade
3. If you want to fine-tune, enter a number manually in **Override Score**

> ⚠️ **Advisory highlight:** if an override falls outside the selected grade's score band, the field turns amber. This is advisory only — the override is still accepted — but review it before finalising.

### 3. Check the Weighting
Criterion weights must total 100%. The tool displays a ✓ when correct and flags an error if they don't balance. Do not proceed if the weighting is incorrect — weighted scores will not calculate.

> In most cases the weighting is already configured correctly and does not need adjusting.

### 4. Review the Suggested Grade
The tool maps your final weighted score to a grade using the scale defined when the scorer was built (default: NZ University scale). Review the suggested grade and use Override Score on individual criteria if you want to fine-tune the result.

## Late Penalties

If a submission is late (check the **Status** field in Moodle — it will say *"Submitted late"*):

1. Use the **Late Submission** dropdown to select the lateness band
2. The appropriate deduction is automatically applied
3. The **Final Score** updates to reflect the penalty

| Band | Deduction |
|---|---|
| On time | 0% |
| Up to 1 day late | –10% |
| Up to 2 days late | –20% |
| Up to 3 days late | –30% |
| More than 3 days late | Grade set to lowest (fail) |

> **Note:** Intro and outro feedback text always reflects the student's *actual work quality* (pre-penalty grade), not the penalised score. The late notice and final penalised score appear at the end of the feedback block.

---

## Cooked Feedback

The **Cooked Feedback** panel automatically assembles:

1. An **intro paragraph** matched to the student's overall tier (based on pre-penalty grade)
2. A **criterion-by-criterion breakdown** with the relevant rubric descriptor for each grade selected
3. The **Total Score**
4. A **closing paragraph** (outro) matched to the student's tier
5. A **Late Submission notice** and final penalised score (if applicable)

To use it:
- Click **Copy Feedback** to copy the full text to your clipboard
- Paste directly into Moodle (or your grading system of choice)

No macros, no exports, no formatting required.

## Building or Editing a Scorer

Click **Build a New Scorer** from the home page to open the 6-step wizard:

| Step | What you configure |
|---|---|
| **1 — Details** | Assessment name, course code, tutor name |
| **2 — Grade Scale** | Choose a preset (NZ University, UK/Australian, US, or Custom) and edit bands if needed |
| **3 — Criteria** | Define each criterion and its percentage weighting (must total 100%) |
| **4 — Rubric** | Write the descriptor shown in feedback for each grade × criterion combination |
| **5 — Feedback** | Write the intro and outro paragraphs for each grade tier |
| **6 — Settings** | Review a summary and save |

To edit an existing scorer, open it from the home page and click **Edit Scorer** (if enabled), or rebuild using the wizard.

### Grade Scale Presets

| Preset | Grades | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| 🇳🇿 NZ University | A+, A, A–, B+, B, B–, C+, C, C–, D | University of Waikato / standard NZ |
| 🇦🇺 UK / Australian | HD, D, C, P, F | High Distinction scale |
| 🇺🇸 US Simple | A, B, C, D, F | Standard A–F |
| ✏️ Custom | Your own | Define labels, bands, and tiers from scratch |

## Privacy & Data Storage

- **Everything stays on your device.** No data is sent to any server.
- Scorers and all configuration are saved in your **browser's localStorage**.
- Clearing your browser data or using a different browser/device will not show your saved scorers.
- Student scores and feedback are **never saved** — the scorer resets for each new student session.
